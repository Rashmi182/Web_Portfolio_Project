# Web_Portfolio_Project
This project is a dynamic web-based resume created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes interactive features such as direct links to my personal/professional website and internal page sections. The profile image changes on double-click, and hovering over the college name adjusts font size and style dynamically.
